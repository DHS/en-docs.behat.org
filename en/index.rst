Behat Documentation
======================

Background
----------

Behat is an open source behavior driven development framework for PHP 5.3.

Behat was inspired by Ruby’s Cucumber project and especially it’s syntax part (Gherkin). It tries to be like Cucumber with input (Feature files) and output (console formatters).

After installation, read this great articles about BDD:

* `Dan North's "What's in a Story?" <http://dannorth.net/whats-in-a-story/>`_
* `Cucumber's "Backgrounder" <https://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/wiki/Cucumber-Backgrounder>`_

Although both tutorials are Cucumber-specific, you’ll soon learn that Behat shares much with Cucumber! Once you’ve finished reading these tutorials, move on to the following topics.
