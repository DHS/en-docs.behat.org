Behat Documentation
===================

Behat is an open source behavior driven development framework for PHP 5.3.
What's *behavior driven development* you ask? It's the idea that you start
by writing human-readable sentences that describes a feature of your application
and how it should work.

For example, imagine you're about the create the famous UNIX ``ls`` command.
Before you begin, you describe how the feature should work:

.. code-block:: gherkin

    Feature: ls
      In order to see the directory structure
      As a UNIX user
      I need to be able to list the current directory's contents

      Scenario:
        Given I am in a directory "test"
          And I have a file named "foo"
          And I have a file named "bar"
         When I run "ls"
         Then I should get:
           """
           bar
           foo
           """

As a developer, your work is done as soon as you've made the ``ls`` command
behave as described in the *Scenario*.

Now, wouldn't it be cool if something could read this sentence and use it to
actually run a test against the ``ls`` command? Hey, that's exactly what Behat
does! As you'll see, Behat is easy to learn, quick to use, and will put the
fun back into your testing.

.. note::

    Behat was inspired by Rubyâ€™s Cucumber project, especially its syntax
    (called Gherkin).

Once you're up and running with Behat, you can learn more about behavioral
driven development via the following links. Though both tutorials are specific
to Cucumber, Behat shares a lot with Cucumber and the philosophies are one
and the same.
