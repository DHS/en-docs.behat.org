Testing Features - ``FeatureContext`` Class
===========================================

We've already used this strange ``FeatureContext`` class as a home for our
:doc:`step definitions </guides/2.definitions>` and :doc:`hooks </guides/3.hooks>`.
But what is it actually?

Context class is a simple POPO (Plain Old PHP Object), that is used by behat
to represent testing part of your features suite. If ``*.feature`` files are
all about describing *how* your application behave, then context class is all
about how to test, that it actually behaves as expected. That's it.
Programmatic representation of your features:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php #features/bootstrap/FeatureContext.php

    use Behat\Behat\Context\BehatContext;

    require_once 'PHPUnit/Autoload.php';
    require_once 'PHPUnit/Framework/Assert/Functions.php';

    class FeatureContext extends BehatContext
    {
        public function __construct(array $parameters)
        {
            $this->useContext(new AnotherContext());
        }

        /** @BeforeFeature */
        public static function prepareForTheFeature()
        {} // clean database or do other preparation stuff

        /** @Given /^we have some context$/ */
        public function prepareContext()
        {} // do something

        /** @When /^event occurs$/ */
        public function doSomeAction()
        {} // do something

        /** @Then /^something should be done$/ */
        public function checkOutcomes()
        {} // do something
    }

Context Class Requirements
--------------------------

In order to be used by Behat, your context class should follow 3 simple rules:

1. Context class should implement ``Behat\Behat\Context\ContextInterface`` or
   extend base ``Behat\Behat\Context\BehatContext`` class (as in example
   above).

2. Context class should be called ``FeatureContext``. It's a simple convention
   inside Behat infrastructure.

3. Context class should be findable and loadable by Behat. It means, that you
   should somehow tell Behat about your class file. The easiest way to do this
   is to put your class file inside ``features/bootstrap/`` folder. All
   ``*.php`` files in this folder will be autoloaded by Behat before any
   feature gets runned.

.. note::

    By convention, context class should be called ``FeatureContext``, but this
    could be easily changed through :doc:`cli</guides/6.cli>` configuration.

The simpliest way to start using Behat in your project is to call ``behat``
with special ``--init`` option inside your project directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ behat --init

After you run this command, Behat will set up a testing directory inside
your project:

.. image:: /images/--init.png
   :align: center

And ``features/bootstrap/FeatureContext.php`` will have inital context class
which will look like this:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php # features/bootstrap/FeatureContext.php

    use Behat\Behat\Context\ClosuredContextInterface,
        Behat\Behat\Context\TranslatedContextInterface,
        Behat\Behat\Context\BehatContext,
        Behat\Behat\Exception\PendingException;
    use Behat\Gherkin\Node\PyStringNode,
        Behat\Gherkin\Node\TableNode;

    /**
     * Features context.
     */
    class FeatureContext extends BehatContext
    {
    }


Contexts Lifetime
-----------------

Your context class gets initialized before each scenario runs and every scenario
has its very own context instance. This means 2 things:

1. Every scenario has isolated from each others context. You can do almost
   anything inside your scenario context instance without the fear to affect
   other scenarios - every scenario will get its own context instance.

2. Every step in a single scenario gets executed inside common context
   instance. This means, that you can set ``private`` instance variables inside
   your ``@Given`` steps and you'll be able to read their new values inside
   your ``@When`` and ``@Then`` steps.

Using Subcontexts
-----------------

At some point, it could become very hard to maintain all your
:doc:`step definitions </guides/2.definitions>` and :doc:`hooks </guides/3.hooks>`
inside one single class. You can actually use class inheritance and split
definitions into multiple classes, but it could become not logical and very
hard to use inheritance for contexts as php doesn't support multiple
inheritance. Behat provides more flexible way to gain reusability.

Behat provides a way to use one or more contexts inside your main context. Such
contexts are called *subcontexts*.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php #features/bootstrap/FeatureContext.php

    use Behat\Behat\Context\BehatContext;

    class FeatureContext extends BehatContext
    {
        public function __construct(array $parameters)
        {
            $this->useContext('subcontext_alias', new SubContext);
        }
    }

``Behat\Behat\Context\BehatContext`` provides special ``useContext()`` instance
method, with which you can connect one or more subcontext instances to your
main ``FeatureContext`` class.

First argument to ``useContext()`` method is always subcontext alias (``subcontext_alias``).
Thanks to it, You'll be able to access any subcontext from another subcontexts
later.

``SubContext`` is the same context class, that should follow same
`Context Class Requirements`_ as main context, except class naming rule, cuz
it doesn't really matter how you call it - you instantiate it with hands before
passing into ``useContext()`` method:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php #features/bootstrap/SubContext.php

    use Behat\Behat\Context\BehatContext;

    class SubContext extends BehatContext
    {
        public function __construct(array $parameters)
        {
            // do subcontext initialization
        }
    }

All :doc:`step definitions </guides/2.definitions>` and
:doc:`hooks </guides/3.hooks>` defined in subcontexts will be successfully
parsed by Behat and made available to use in your features right away.

If you need to pass something into your subcontext - it's your job actually:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php #features/bootstrap/FeatureContext.php

    use Behat\Behat\Context\BehatContext;

    class FeatureContext extends BehatContext
    {
        public function __construct(array $parameters)
        {
            $this->useContext(new SubContext(array(
                /* custom params */
            )));
        }
    }

.. note::

    Behat's subcontexts is a way to achieve horizontal reusability in php
    before we officailly get *traits* in php 5.4.

Communications Between Contexts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you might need to call specific context method or attribute from
within another context. In such case, base as of 2.0.4, ``BehatContext``
provides two very useful methods:

1. ``getMainContext()`` - returns main context instance in which all other
   contexts are used.

2. ``getSubcontext($alias)`` - returns context's subcontext by it's alias name,
   that you specify during ``useContext()`` call.

Keeping this in mind, you can always call any context method with simple:

.. code-block:: php

    $this->getMainContext()->getSubcontexts('subcontext_alias')->some_method();

call.

Creating Very Own Context Class
-------------------------------

The easiest way to start with Behat is to just extend base ``Behat\Behat\Context\BehatContext``
class. But what if you do not want to inherit from any class in your code?
Then you should create your own context class, that Behat will be able to use.

As we've pointed before, in order to be able to use your custom class as
Behat context, it should define simple interface:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    namespace Behat\Behat\Context;

    interface ContextInterface
    {
        function getSubcontexts();
        function getSubcontextByClassName($className);
    }

This interface actually have only 2 methods:

* ``getSubcontexts()`` should return array of subcontext instances (if has any).

* ``getSubcontextByClassName()`` should find subcontext instance by provided
  class name. It's used in order to be sure, that your subcontext definitions
  will be always called inside proper context instance.

So, your custom very own ``FeatureContext`` class could look like this:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php #features/bootstrap/FeatureContext.php

    use Behat\Behat\Context\ContextInterface;

    class FeatureContext implements ContextInterface
    {
        private $subcontext;

        public function __construct()
        {
            $this->subcontext = new SubContext();
        }

        public function getSubcontexts()
        {
            return array($this->subcontext);
        }

        public function getSubcontextByClassName($className)
        {
            if ('SubContext' === $className) {
                return $this->subcontext;
            }
        }
    }
